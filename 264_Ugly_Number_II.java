// Using the idea of merging sort to get the nth Ugly Number.
// The idear is that, we can divide the numbers into three sequence, although they can be dunplicated.
// 2 * (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, ...)
// 3 * (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, ...)
// 5 * (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, ...)
// set three pointer for each sequence, every time we pick the lowest one, then move to the next pointer.
