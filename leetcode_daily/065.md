[65](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-number/) Valid Number


Brute force method. Need to consider many corner cases!!!

```python
# We start with trimming.

# If we see [0-9] we reset the number flags.
# We can only see . if we didn't see e or ..
# We can only see e if we didn't see e but we did see a number. We reset numberAfterE flag.
# We can only see + and - in the beginning and after an e
# any other character break the validation.
# At the and it is only valid if there was at least 1 number and if we did see an e then a number after it as well.

# So basically the number should match this regular expression:

# [-+]?(([0-9]+(.[0-9]*)?)|.[0-9]+)(e[-+]?[0-9]+)?
