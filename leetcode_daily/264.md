[264](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number-ii/) Ugly Number II

Using the idea of merging sort. Every time we need to select the minimum number from three numbers, num1 is num * 2 where num is the number that has not been used for x2, num2 is num * 3, and num3 is num * 5. Therefore we use three pointer to indicate the three positions.  


Pay attention that there are three `if` but not `else if`.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        p1 = 0
        p2 = 0
        p3 = 0
        nums = [0 for i in range(n)]
        nums[0] = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            val = min(nums[p1]*2, nums[p2]*3, nums[p3]*5)
            if val == nums[p1]*2:
                p1 += 1
            if val == nums[p2]*3:
                p2 += 1
            if val == nums[p3]*5:
                p3 += 1
            nums[i] = val
        return nums[n - 1]
