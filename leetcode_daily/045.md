[45](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/) Jump Game II

memorize the maximum reach position, and current count. Use one pass method which is O(N).

```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: 'List[int]') -> 'int':
        m = 0
        end = 0
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i > end:
                count += 1
                end = m
            m = max(m, i + nums[i])
        return count
```
