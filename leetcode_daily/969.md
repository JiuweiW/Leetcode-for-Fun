[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/pancake-sorting/) Sort

Only need to understand a small trick. Find the smallest number and flip it to the front and then flip it to the end. 

```
class Solution(object):
    def pancakeSort(self, A):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        if len(A) == 1:
            return []
        length = len(A)
        res = []
        for i in range(len(A)):
            for j in range(length):
                if A[j] == length:
                    res.append(j + 1)
                    res.append(length)
                    A[0:j+1] = A[0:j+1][::-1]
                    A[0:length] = A[0:length][::-1]
                    break
            length -= 1
        return res
```
