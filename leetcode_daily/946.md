[946](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-stack-sequences/) Validate Stack Sequences. 

Use stack.

```python
class Solution:
    def validateStackSequences(self, pushed: List[int], popped: List[int]) -> bool:
        count = 0
        stack = []
        for n in pushed:
            stack.append(n)
            # there is one value in stack equal to popped list.
            while stack and count < len(popped) and stack[-1] == popped[count]:
                stack.pop()
                count += 1
        return count == len(popped)
```
