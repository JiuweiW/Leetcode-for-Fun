[518](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-2/) Coin Change 2

DP method.
Think about why we need to loop for the coins firstly and then loop for the amount.

```python
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [0 for i in range(amount + 1)]
        dp[0] = 1
        for coin in coins:
            for m in range(1, amount + 1):
               if m >= coin:
                   dp[m] += dp[m - coin]
        return dp[amount]
```
