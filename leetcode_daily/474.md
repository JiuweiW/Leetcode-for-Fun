Algorithm is right but got TLE in leetcode.

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxForm(self, strs: List[str], m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0 for i in range(n + 1)] for j in range(m + 1)]
        for s in strs:
            count = collections.Counter(s)
            zero = count.get("0", 0)
            one = count.get("1", 0)
            for i in range(m, zero - 1, -1):
                for j in range(n, one - 1, -1):
                    dp[i][j] = max(1 + dp[i - zero][j - one], dp[i][j])
        return dp[m][n]
```

This makes one line change and is accepted.

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxForm(self, strs: List[str], m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0]*(n + 1) for j in range(m + 1)]
        for s in strs:
            count = collections.Counter(s)
            zero = count.get("0", 0)
            one = count.get("1", 0)
            for i in range(m, zero - 1, -1):
                for j in range(n, one - 1, -1):
                    dp[i][j] = max(1 + dp[i - zero][j - one], dp[i][j])
        return dp[m][n]
