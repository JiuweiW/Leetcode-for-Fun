The data in stored in a linked list. Just be careful about how the stack can save the informations

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def nextLargerNodes(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        res = []
        if head is None:
            return res
        stack = []
        idx = 0
        while head is not None:
            while len(stack) != 0 and stack[-1][1] < head.val:
                i, val = stack.pop()
                res[i] = head.val
            stack.append([idx, head.val])
            res.append(0)
            idx += 1
            head = head.next
        return res
```

Better solution from [Lee215](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-node-in-linked-list/discuss/265508/JavaC%2B%2BPython-Next-Greater-Element). He improved the code slightly.

```python
    def nextLargerNodes(self, head):
        res, stack = [], []
        while head:
            while stack and stack[-1][1] < head.val:
                res[stack.pop()[0]] = head.val
            stack.append([len(res), head.val])
            res.append(0)
            head = head.next
        return res
```
