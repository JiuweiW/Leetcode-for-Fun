Thinking carefully and you will notice the hint.

```python
# brute force is O(NlogN)
# You should notice that the result is always smaller than len(nums) - 1.
# Then the thing you need to do is to mark the position in place.
# be careful for several corner cases, such as result = 1 or negative number in the list
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: 'List[int]') -> 'int':
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(nums)
        # change 0, negative
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] <= 0:
                nums[i] = n + 1
        # change the value in exist positions into negative
        for i in range(n):
            val = abs(nums[i])
            if  val <= n and nums[val - 1] > 0:
