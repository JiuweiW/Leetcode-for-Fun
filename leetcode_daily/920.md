[920](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-music-playlists/) Number of music playlists.

Notice:

1. The order doesn't matter. Once you get one playlist, you can randomly switch any songs to create a new playlist.
2. There are two constrains when you choose the next song. a) every song is played > 1 times. b) A song can be played while K other songs have been played.   

We can think about DFS method fristly. Then we notice that there are some duplicate calculations. 
    
```python

class Solution(object):
    def numMusicPlaylists(self, N, L, K):
        # dp[S] at time P = <S, P> as discussed in article
        dp = [1] * (L-N+1)
        for p in range(2, N-K+1):
            for i in range(1, L-N+1):
                dp[i] += dp[i-1] * p

        # Multiply by N!
        ans = dp[-1]
        for k in range(2, N+1):
            ans *= k
        return ans % (10**9 + 7)
```

LRU cache

```python
# LRU 
from functools import lru_cache
class Solution:
    def numMusicPlaylists(self, N: int, L: int, K: int) -> int:
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(i, j):
            if i == 0:
                return +(j == 0)
            ans = dp(i-1, j-1) * (N-j+1)
            ans += dp(i-1, j) * max(j-K, 0)
            return ans % (10**9+7)
        return dp(L, N)
```


DP solution from [discussion](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-music-playlists/discuss/178415/C%2B%2BJavaPython-DP-Solution)

```python
def numMusicPlaylists(self, N, L, K):
    dp = [[0 for i in range(L + 1)] for j in range(N + 1)]
    for i in range(K + 1, N + 1):
        for j in range(i, L + 1):
            if i == j or i == K + 1:
                dp[i][j] = math.factorial(i)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] * i + dp[i][j - 1] * (i - K)
    return dp[N][L] % (10**9 + 7)
