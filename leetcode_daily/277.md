[277](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-celebrity/) Find the Celebrity


My solution, not so beautiful. I didn't notice that 0 could also be the solution in the beginning.

```python
# The knows API is already defined for you.
# @param a, person a
# @param b, person b
# @return a boolean, whether a knows b
# def knows(a, b):

class Solution(object):
    def findCelebrity(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        ans = [0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if knows(0, i):
                ans.append(i)

        for people in ans:
            flag = True
            for i in range(n):
                # print("-people ", people, "i, j ", i, people)
                if people == i:
                    continue
                if knows(people, i) or not knows(i, people):
                    flag = False
                    break
            if flag:
                return people
        return -1

```


```python
def findCelebrity(self, n):
    x = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        if knows(x, i):
            x = i
    if any(knows(x, i) for i in xrange(x)):
        return -1
    if any(not knows(i, x) for i in xrange(n)):
        return -1
    return x

```
