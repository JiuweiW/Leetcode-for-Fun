[997](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge) Find teh town judge.

My solution is complicate. I search for the potential candidates with no trust people. and check whether each of them can be the judge. 

```python
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, N: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m = {}
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            m[i] = []
        for t in trust:
            m[t[0]].append(t[1])
            
        potential = set()
        for key, val in m.items():
            if len(val) == 0:
                potential.add(key)
        if len(potential) == 0:
            return -1
            
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            newp = potential.copy()
            for p in newp:
                if p == i:
                    continue
                if not p in m[i]:
                    potential.remove(p)
        if len(potential) == 1:
            return potential.pop()
        return -1
```

Intuition:
Consider trust as a graph, all pairs are directed edge.
The point with in-degree - out-degree = N - 1 become the judge.

Explanation:
Count the degree, and check at the end.

Time Complexity:
Time O(T + N), space O(N)

```python
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, N: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        count = [0] * (N + 1)
        for i, j in trust:
            count[i] -= 1
            count[j] += 1
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            if count[i] == N - 1:
                return i
        return -1
```
