[334](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/) Increasing Triplet Subsequence

Interesting `DP` solution. Need to think about how to get the best solution.

```python
# brute force is O(n3)
# you will notice that if you already found a small number, you can always use it as the first number. Then you can save the minimum when passing through the list. The same idea for the second and the third numbers. Time complexity O(n)
class Solution:
    def increasingTriplet(self, nums: 'List[int]') -> 'bool':
        one = float("inf")
        two = float("inf")
        three = float("inf")
        for n in nums:
            if n <= one:
                one = n
            elif n <= two:
                two = n
            elif n <= three:
                return True
        return False
    
    
```
