[502](https://leetcode.com/problems/ipo/)  IPO

Greedy solution. There is no clear guide to find whether the problem is greedy or not. You should think carefully and clearly or be very smart, and you are able to know immediately that the greedy is the best solution.

```python
# Every time you peak the maximum profit you can with your current capital
# Need one heap to save the projects those haven't been selected and under the captical.
# Need the other heap to save the projects those haven't been selected but above the captical.
class Solution:
    def findMaximizedCapital(self, k: 'int', W: 'int', Profits: 'List[int]', Capital: 'List[int]') -> 'int':
        large_heap = [(Capital[i], i)  for i in range(len(Capital))]
        heapq.heapify(large_heap)
        small_heap = []

        for i in range(k):
            while len(large_heap) != 0 and large_heap[0][0] <= W:
                heapq.heappush(small_heap, -Profits[large_heap[0][1]])
                heapq.heappop(large_heap)
            if len(small_heap) > 0:
                W += -heapq.heappop(small_heap)
        return W
