[475](https://leetcode.com/problems/heaters/) Heaters


Be careful for one corner case that. For some heater, you can just jump over it. 


```python
class Solution:
    def findRadius(self, houses: List[int], heaters: List[int]) -> int:
        houses = sorted(houses)
        heaters = sorted(heaters)
        i = 0
        l = 0
        res = 0
        while i < len(houses):
            r = l + 1
            while  r < len(heaters) and abs(heaters[l]-houses[i]) >= abs(heaters[r]-houses[i]):
                l = r
                r += 1
            res = max(res, abs(heaters[l] - houses[i]))
            # print(heaters[l], houses[i], res)
            i += 1
        return res
```

There are other methods to solve the problem, such as DP, binary search.
