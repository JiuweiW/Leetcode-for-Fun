[1022](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-integer-divisible-by-k/) Smallest Integer Divisible by K

I use a `set` to include all the remainder it has seen.

```python
class Solution:
    def smallestRepunitDivByK(self, K: int) -> int:
        if K == 1:
            return 1
        if K % 2 == 0:
            return -1
        seen = set([])
        n = 1
        count = 1
        num = 1
        while not num in seen:
            if num == 0:
                return count
            elif num in seen:
                return -1
            seen.add(num)
            count += 1
            n = n*10 + 1
            num = n % K
        return -1
```

This solution depends on math. The best solution can be found in [discussion](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-integer-divisible-by-k/discuss/260852/JavaC%2B%2BPython-Brute-Force-O(K)-Time-O(1)-Space). You can find lee's video in [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxVUCzee-XI).

Intuition:
If N exist, N <= K, just do a brute force check.
Also if K % 2 == 0, return -1, because 111....11 can't be even.
Also if K % 5 == 0, return -1, because 111....11 can't end with 0 or 5.


Explanation
For different N, we calculate the remainder of mod K.
It has to use the remainder for these two reason:

Integer overflow
The division operation, is NOT O(1), it's actually O(logN).

Prove
Why 5 is a corner case? It has a reason and we can find it.
Assume that N = 1 to N = K, if there isn't 111...11 % K == 0
There are at most K - 1 different remainders: 1, 2, .... K - 1.

So this is a pigeon holes problem:
There must be at least 2 same remainders.

Assume that,
f(N) ≡ f(M), N > M
f(N - M) * 10 ^ M ≡ 0
10 ^ M ≡ 0, mod K
so that K has factor 2 or factor 5.

Proof by contradiction，
if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) return -1;
otherwise, there must be a solution N <= K.

Time Complexity:
Time O(K), Space O(1)
```

```python
    def smallestRepunitDivByK(self, K):
        if K % 2 == 0 or K % 5 == 0: return -1
        r = 0
        for N in range(1, K + 1):
            r = (r * 10 + 1) % K
            if not r: return N
```
